Notes
=======================
This is an extensive freebie with two unique forms â€” one for logging in to a website, and another for registering. It's all wrapped up in a beautiful CSS3 layout, with unique states for click/hover events, and functionality for intelligently replacing the default text within the form. We think it's really great!
